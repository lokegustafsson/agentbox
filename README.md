This will hopefully be some kind of graphical agent-control physics sandbox at some point.

Preliminary todo list:

- Particle-particle collision (only spheres or other hitboxes?)
- A pretty background
- Air resistance
- Replace the bounding ball tree with something that is better for long and thin shapes
- Orientation-forcing joints
